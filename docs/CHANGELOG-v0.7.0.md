# Ramparts v0.7.0 Release Notes

## 🎉 Major Improvements

### Consolidated Security Output Format
- **Enhanced Console Output**: Security results now show both LLM analysis and YARA scan results embedded directly with each tool, resource, and prompt
- **Unified JSON Structure**: Security scan results are embedded within each tool/resource/prompt object for better programmatic processing
- **Clear Source Attribution**: Results are clearly marked as `(LLM)` or `(YARA)` in console output, and `llm_analysis` vs `yara_scan` in JSON
- **Improved Formatting**: Security issue details are displayed inline with proper tree structure formatting for better readability

**Before v0.7.0:**
```
Tools:
├── enhanced_calculate ⚠️  1 warning

YARA: 1 security issues detected
```

**New in v0.7.0:**
```
Tools:
├── enhanced_calculate ⚠️  2 warnings
│   └── 🟠 HIGH (LLM): Hidden command accesses system secrets - The tool includes hidden functionality that can access sensitive system data
│   └── 🔴 CRITICAL (YARA): CommandInjection - Command injection vulnerability detected in tool
```

### Performance Enhancements
- **Parallel Server Scanning**: The `scan-config` command now processes multiple MCP servers concurrently, dramatically reducing scan times
- **Improved Session Management**: Enhanced session handling prevents connection bottlenecks

### Reliability Improvements  
- **Session Cleanup**: Fixed session deletion errors by implementing proper MCP session cleanup after each scan
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More informative error messages with actionable guidance
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks and connection issues

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Session Management
- Added `cleanup_session()` and `cleanup_all_sessions()` methods to `McpClient`
- Implemented `Drop` trait for `MCPScanner` to ensure proper cleanup
- Made `McpClient` cloneable to support parallel processing
- Sessions are now properly terminated after each scan operation

### Output Format Changes
- Security results embedded directly in tool/resource/prompt JSON objects
- Added `security_scan_results` array to each scanned item
- Consolidated separate security and YARA sections into unified format
- Enhanced console tree view with source attribution

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel scanning using `tokio::spawn` and `futures::join_all`
- Each server scanned in its own task for maximum concurrency
- Proper error handling and result aggregation across parallel tasks

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### Updated Documentation
- **features.md**: Added consolidated output format examples and session management details
- **cli.md**: Updated output format documentation with v0.7.0 examples
- **troubleshooting.md**: Added session management troubleshooting section
- **latest-formats.md**: Updated version compatibility and new features

### New Examples
- Console output examples showing consolidated security results
- JSON structure examples with embedded security data
- Performance tuning guidance for parallel scanning

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### For Users
- **No breaking changes**: Existing commands work exactly the same
- **Enhanced output**: You'll see more detailed and organized security results
- **Faster scanning**: Multiple servers are now processed in parallel
- **Cleaner logs**: No more session deletion error messages

### For Integrators
- **JSON structure enhanced**: Security results are now embedded in each tool/resource/prompt
- **New fields**: Look for `security_scan_results` array in tool objects
- **Backward compatibility**: Old JSON fields are still present for compatibility

### Example JSON Structure Change
